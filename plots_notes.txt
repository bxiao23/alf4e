PLOT PLANNING

mu stack
	N and E on same axes with phi on x-axis
	each plot for given value of mu; stack on top of each other for comparisons
	question: how to encode varied L?

U stack
	single plot; fixed mu
	E on y-axis with phi on x-axis
	plot multiple dispersions (multiple values of U)
	same question: how to encode varied L?
